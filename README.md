revenge-of-the-octocat
======================


This project will be a top down rpg of a style similar to the original legend of zelda. The basic story idea is that there is a bug in the Github servers and the octocat needs to go a fix it. There will be the firing of a projectile and a normal attack that hits directly in front.
The basic code base will have a jpanel or similar object on top of the main field for each mobile element, including the player character, enemies, and projectiles. 
There will be two major components of the background. A textfield (uneditable *usually*) at the bottom for dialogue and messages and a square field that represents play area. The pop up window will **not** be resizeable.
Movement will be controlled with the arrow keys and attacking will use the z and x keys.


###Checklist:
 - [X] Basic setup (Window formating, image creation and management, etc.)
 - [X] Character basics (Positioning, sprite, etc.)
 - [X] controls (arrow keys and z/x, enemy random/ordered movement)
 - [X] collision/attack detection (overlapping panels/sprites)
 - [X] ammo system (probably simple at this point, but definitely an embelishment.)
 - [ ] Storyline
 - [ ] Splash Screen
 - [ ] Art!
